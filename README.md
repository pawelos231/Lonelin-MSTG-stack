# MSTG-stack-test

I know the name of this stack does not sound very appeling but i think it will be very interesting to build something in it !
this tech stack contains:

- S - SvelteKit (for rendering frontEnd)
- T - tailwind (to deal with stupid css)
- G - Golang (to deal with backend)
- M - mongodb as a database
  Project will include basic CRUD funcionalites, it will look similar to the one i already have on my repository in the MERN stack tab
