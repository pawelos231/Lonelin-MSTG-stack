# MSTG-stack-test

I know the name of this stack does not sound very appeling but i think it will be very interesting to build something in it !
this tech stack contains:

- S - SvelteKit (for rendering frontEnd)
- T - tailwind (to deal with stupid css)
- G - Golang (to deal with backend)
- M - mongodb as a database  


Project will include CRUD funcionalites, it will cover both frontend and backend, project will resemble reddit, instead of rest API it will feature grapghql, it will also contain 3D games, created in three.js and ammo.js, it any idea pops into my head it will be featured in this project i also hope to create some rust based functionalities and many more.
